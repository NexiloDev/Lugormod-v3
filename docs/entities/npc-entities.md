### Key Chart:
```
* = Entity is triggerable.
** = Entity can be targeted to work. Or has to be.
*** = Is an entity that is placed that doesn't need to be targeted/triggered to work.
(L) = Either a new entity created for Lugormod, or if an existing entity then edited for Lugormod.
```

- So if an entity has **(L) by it that means that it was created for Lugormod, or was edited, and has to be targeted to work.

# NPC Entities

## NPC_spawner **(L)
Spawns a NPC that you specify, remember all keys are case sensative.(Its not npc_type, its NPC_type), if this is going to be used by a button add "count,-1," so it can spawn more than once.

### Spawnflags:

```
16      - NPC can be in air, but will spawn on the closest floor surface below it
32      - Will spawn with no default AI (BS_CINEMATIC), or the blinking that happens when it spawns
64      - NPC will not be solid (can not be shot or attacked with saber, so will not get agressive)
256     - Spawner is shy (wont spawn if a player is looking at it)
```

```
