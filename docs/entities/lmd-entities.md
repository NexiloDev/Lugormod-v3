**Last Update:** 13 October 2025

**Note:** This documentation relates to the latest version of Lugormod v3. Some entities may differ or not exist in prior versions of Lugormod. (https://lugormod.com/downloads/).

### Key Chart:
```
* = Entity is triggerable.
** = Entity can be targeted to work. Or has to be.
*** = Is an entity that is placed that doesn't need to be targeted/triggered to work.
(L) = Either a new entity created for Lugormod, or if an existing entity then edited for Lugormod.
```

- So if an entity has **(L) by it that means that it was created for Lugormod, or was edited, and has to be targeted to work.

# lmd_ Entities

## lmd_chance * (L)
When used, gets a random number between 1 and "count", and will go from "chance" to "chance6" checking if its number is less than or equal to it.
Will fire the first target found then stop.

### Keys:

```
chance    - Number to compare
chance2   - Number to compare
chance3   - Number to compare
chance4   - Number to compare
chance5   - Number to compare
chance6   - Number to compare
count     - The maxmum random number to generate
target    - Corresponding target to fire.
target2   - Corresponding target to fire.
target3   - Corresponding target to fire.
target4   - Corresponding target to fire.
target5   - Corresponding target to fire.
target6   - Corresponding target to fire.
```

### Example Code:

```
/place lmd_chance * count,7,chance,1,chance2,2,chance3,3,chance4,4,target,hit_1,target2,hit_2,target3,hit_3,target4_hit4,
```

- This randomly genrates a number from 1-7 and fire the target if the number is the same. If it goes over 4, it doesn't fire anything. 4/7 of the time it will do nothing.

## lmd_restrict *(L)
Restricts the person inside of it by whatever spawnflags are set. Use maxs/mins to set the bounding box.

### Spawnflags:

```
1     - Damage restrict, the people inside cannot be inflicted with damage
2     - Restrict forcepowers
        (includes non-offensive force heal/protect etc...)
4     - No jetpack
8     - No duels, existing duels break if a player enters this.
16    - No firing weapons
128   - Start inactive, must be hit by a target_activate entity to become active.
256   - Alow Desann Stance
512   - Allow Tavion Stance
```

### Keys:

```
maxs/mins
```

### Example code:

```
/place lmd_restrict 0 mins,-500 -500 0,maxs,500 500 500,spawnflags,3,
```

- Restricts damage and forcepowers in the defined area.

## lmd_stashzone ***(L)
A zone to define an area for stashes. Also controls how many stashes can be spawned per zone. A stash may be set to delete itself when removed from its zone.

### Spawnflags:

```
1 - start inactive (stashes with no active zone can be taken anywhere).
2 - master zone. Any stash spawns that are outside a zone by their zone key will be affected by the count key of a master zone. 
    Having multiple zones under a single key with this spawnflag is stupid.
```

### Keys:

```
targetname  - name of this zone.
count       - number of stashes that can be spawned at once within this zone. This overrides any settings of individual stash spawns. 
              This is per zone-entity.
              if a stash is brought into another zone of the same name but out of this one it will no longer count for this zone.
```

### Example code:

```
/place lmd_stashzone 0 mins,-1200 -1200 -1200,maxs,1200 1200 1200,spawnflags,2,targetname,main_stashzone,count,1,
```

## lmd_stashspawnpoint ***(L)
Point where stashes spawn. Can be triggered to manually spawn a stash. Multiple stashes can be spawned at once. It is possible to make a stash with 0 credits for the purpose of making it use a target when deposited (see the deposittarget key). A new stash will not spawn if the last one has not been picked up. stash spawn points that have been deactivated will not spawn stashes, although they will still run their spawn timers (they will just not spawn the stash when the timer fires). Important: if you want to use the traditional method of one stash spawning randomly, make sure all stash spawns have a random key, else only one point will spawn stashes. Or just set the spawn time to 0 and use a target_random targeting all the spawn points.

### Spawnflags:

```
1       - spawnmessage global: send the spawnmessage to everyone in the server (rather than in the stash zone), if the spawnmessage key is set.
2       - spawnmessage screen print: send the spawnmessage as a screen print, as well as in the console.
4       - pickupmessage global: send the pickup message to everyone in the server (rather than in the stash zone), if the pickupmessage key is set.
8       - pickupmessage screen print: send the pickupmessage as a screen print, as well as in the console.
16      - dropmessage global.
32      - dropmessage screen print.
64      - startdepomessage global.
128     - startdepomessage screen print.
256     - depositmessage global.
512     - depositmessage screen print.
1024    - resetmessage global.
2048    - resetmessage screen print.
4096    - display stash amount: include the credits amount on all stash messages.
8192    - stashes can spawn here even if a stash has been spawned by another spawn within the zone.
16384   - start disabled. Needs to be used by a target_activate to start spawning.
32768   - reset credits shift when dropped.
65536   - Stashes in this zone will respawn at this spawn. If no spawns have this set, stashes will not reset and just delete themselves.
131072  - Delete the stash if it leaves the zone. See zoneexittime and zoneexitmessage keys.

/place lmd_propertyterminal 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/f_con2,spawnflags,2,target,my_door,property,flips_door,
```

- This is what you would do for the first group of people you want, if you wanted to have another terminal for another group you would change the count, or property set:

```
/place lmd_propertyterminal 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/f_con2,spawnflags,2,target,his_door,property,somedudes_door,

This will change the shader on the map to another shader you specify. If no targetname is set, it will change shaders for you on map start

### Spawnflags

```
1 - Toggable, switches from new to old when targeted.
```

### Keys:

```
old - the shader directory of what you want to change.
new - the shader directory of what your changing the shader into.
targetname - the name of the entity, when someone fires at this it will change the shader you are referring to.
```

### Example code:

### iObject type keys

```
* upcount (combinable) Inverse keycard, for collection quests.
        property: Name of the property to grant access to when enough of these are picked up.
        max: Grant access to the property when "current" is greater than or equal to this.
        count: Current number of item type picked up. When another upcount item with the same name and property key is picked up, 
               this number is increased by the new item's current value. Defaults to 1.

* downcount (combinable) Keycard 2.0
        property: The property to grant access to while "current" is less than "count".
        max: Maximum number of times to allow access to the property.
        count: Current number of uses left.
        noAutoDelete: Set this to 1 to disable automatic deletion this item when it runs out of uses.

        While "keycard" still will spawn using a conversion placeholder for backwards compatibility, its item no longer officially exists. 
        Use "downcount" instead.
```

## lmd_customskill
An entity that, when used, creates a new custom skill for the person who targets it.

### Spawnflags:

```
1 - (Use with Value key) rather than adding value to player's current skill, entity will set player's value for this skill to the amount set in the value key.
```

### Keys:

```
skill   - Name of the skill (choose your own)
value   - Essentially the "level" of the skill
```

## lmd_mover **(L)
A moving model can be used to do movements for pendulum/rotating/bobbing/door for any of the ontype,onatype,offtype,offatype keys use the list of available movements and specify it to that number. Ex: ontype,0, for don't move at all. The entity is toggleable so if you use its targetname it will switch to its off state. by default its off state movement type is 0.

### Spawnflags:

```
1 - The set model will be solid
```

### Keys:

```
model           - the md3 model to draw
targetname      - make the trigger target this value for the entity to be used
```

Types - Use the movements list, an 'ontype/offtype' is for movement, while an 'onatype/offatype' is a rotation.

```
ontype          - Movement type when in the on state (See types of movement list)
offtype         - Movement type when in the off state (See types of movement list)
onatype         - Rotation type when in the on state (See types of movement list)
offatype        - Rotation type when in the off state (See types of movement list)
```

Durations - The time it takes for the model to complete its action in milliseconds. An 'onduration/offduration' is for the time it takes to complete a movement, while an 'onaduration/offaduration' is the time it takes to complete a rotation.

```
onduration      - The time it takes for the model to move to the set delta when in the on state (milliseconds)
offduration     - The time it takes for the model to move to the set delta when in the off state (milliseconds)
onaduration     - The time it takes for the model to rotate to the set delta when in the on state (milliseconds)
offaduration    - The time it takes for the model to rotate to the set delta when in the off state (milliseconds)
```

Deltas - How far something will move/rotate to. An 'ondelta/offdelta' is how far the model will move. An 'onadelta/offadelta' how far the model will rotate to.

```
ondelta         - How many units to move to when in the on state. (X Y Z)
offdelta        - How many units to move to when in the off state. (X Y Z)
onadelta        - How far the model will rotate to from the base of the model in the on state. (X Y Z)
offadelta       - How far the model will rotate to from the base off the model in the off state. (X Y Z)
```

### Types Of Movement

```
0       - Don't move at all.
1       - Teleport between starting and ending point.
2       - Move towards its goal, after its goal is reached it will keep moving forever. Use this movement type for models that rotate.
3       - Move towards its goal, and stop when the goal is reached.
4       - Move towards its goal, near the end it will start to decelerate then stop.
5       - Slowly accelerate towards middle of goal. Accelerating fastest at the middle of its goal then slowly start to decelerate 
          after it hit the middle of its goal towards the end. It will come back down to the starting point and keep moving like that forever. 
          Use this for bobbing and pendulums.
6       - This one is kind of pointless. It will ignore any set delta keys and fall to the ground at 800 units per second (Default Gravity Setting) 
          and ignores any objects in its way. So it will keep falling through the floor.
```

### Example code:

Because this is new and not a lot of people understand it I will explain how to do the same movements t2_pendulum, t2_bobbing, and t2_rotating used to do.

```
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/desert/3po_head,onaduration,1000,onadelta,0 180 0,onatype,2,
```

- Spawns a sphere that will rotate 180 degrees and keep rotating for ever it takes 1 second to complete its goal

```
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/catw2_b,spawnflags,1,ontype,5,onduration,3000,ondelta,0 0 200
```

- Spawns a catwalk that will bob up and down 200 units. It takes 3 seconds to complete its goal

```
/place lmd_mover 0 model,models/map_objects/factory/catw2_b,onaduration,5000,onatype,5,onadelta,50 0 0,angles,90 0 0,spawnflags,1,
```

- Spawns a catwalk that will swing in a pendulum motion 50 units back and forth takes 5 seconds to complete the full movement

## lmd_rentterminal *(L)
